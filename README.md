# Feature for AdminBro

This is a repository with custom components.

## AdminBro

AdminBro is an automatic admin interface which can be plugged into your application. You, as a developer, provide database models (like posts, comments, stores, products or whatever else your application uses), and AdminBro generates UI which allows you (or other trusted users) to manage content.

Check out the example application with mongo and postgres models here: https://admin-bro-example-app-staging.herokuapp.com/admin

Or visit [AdminBro](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro) github page.
